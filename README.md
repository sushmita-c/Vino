The original VINO concept offered a comprehensive, one-stop-shop solution to the wine purchasing process; beginning with educating consumers in making informed decisions that would quickly redefine wine heuristics; previous works in the online marketplace are driven by taxing wine recommendation services (i.e. via extensive questionnaires). They fail to account for the total picture - many of these sights suffered greatly from the Vegas effect, overwhelming users with aesthetics and little utility. Vino quickly became an opportunity to redefine the aesthetics of the process!

Considering this, the original Vino concept sought to tackle four key concepts, integral to the wine purchasing domain. These concepts were as follows: 
(i) purchasing wine by mood (i.e. how the consumer was currently feeling); 
(ii) purchasing wine by food (i.e. what the consumer was looking to have with their meal); 
(iii) purchasing wine from exploration (i.e. offering options for a more adventurous user) and; 
(iv) purchasing wine from the best vendor (i.e. an alternative means of search to the VINO audience).
